GAME OF GREED

You are playing a game with your â€˜k' friends. 
You have an array of N coins, at each index i you have a coin 
of value a[i].

Your task is to divide the coins, among a group of K friends 
by doing consecutive segments (k-subarrays) of the array.

Each friend will get a total sum of the coins in that subarray. 
Since all your friends are greedy, and they will pick the largest) 
k-1 segments and you will get the smallest segment. Find out the
maximum value you can make by making an optimal partition.

Note: The coins array may or may not be sorted!


Input:
    K = 3
    coins = {1, 2, 3, 4}

Output:
    3

Explanation:
    Ideal partition looks like this
    {1 + 2} = 3
    {3} = 3
    {4} = 4
    You will get max of 3 coins in best case
