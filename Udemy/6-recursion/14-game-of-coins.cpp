GAME OF COINS (DONT UNDERSTAND YET)

Oswald and Henry are playing the game of coins. 
They have a row of 'nâ€™ coins [C1.C2.C3..Cn] with values 
[V1.V2.V3..Vn] where Ci coin has Vi value. They take turns 
alternatively. In one turn the player can pick either the 
first or the last coin of the row. Given both Oswald and Henry 
are very smart players, you need to find the maximum possible 
value Oswald can earn if he plays first.

Input Format:
    In the function you are given an integer N i.e, 
    the number of coins and a vector V which represents 
    the values of each coin in the row respectively.

Output Format:
    Return a single integer which is the maximum possible value 
    as asked in the question.

Constraints:
    1 <= N <= 15
    1 <= V[i] <= 1000
    
    
Input:
    4
    1 2 3 4

Output:
    6

Explanation:
    Oswald will pick up coin with value 4, Henry will pick coin 
    with value 3, Oswald will pick 2 and
    Henry will pick 1. Hence 4 + 2 = 6.
